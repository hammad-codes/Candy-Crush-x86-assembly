# Candy-Crush-x86-assembly

This repository contains a Candy Crush game that was developed as part of the Computer Organization and Assembly Language class at FAST NUCES during the Spring 2021 semester.

# Description
The Candy Crush game is a popular puzzle game that challenges players to match candies of the same color in order to score points. This implementation was developed using x86 assembly language, providing a hands-on learning experience with low-level programming concepts.

# Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and teaching assistants of the Computer Organization and Assembly Language class at FAST NUCES for their guidance and support throughout the development of this project. Their expertise and knowledge have been invaluable.
